libGDX Setup UI
===============
This is the old setup UI by [Aurelien Ribon](http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/), which fetches a [release](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/releases) or [nightly](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies) build of libgdx and then generates Eclipse projects.

This setup UI has been replaced by the new [Gradle-based setup](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-Setup-Gradle). This repository is meant for users that can not use the Gradle based setup for some reason.

We will accept pull requests for this repository but will not actively maintain the project.

###[Download Latest](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/downloads/gdx-setup-ui.jar)

### Building & Running
You'll need Ant and a JDK on your `PATH`. In the root directoyr type `ant`, which will produce a gdx-setup-ui-jar which you can execute by double clicking it in a UI or running it via `java -jar gdx-setup-ui.jar`

Refer to the old [wiki article](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-setup,-running-&-debugging) for more info.
